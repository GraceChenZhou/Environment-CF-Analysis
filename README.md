# Title
Built environment factors predictive of early rapid lung function decline in cystic fibrosis

# Abstract
## Background
The extent to which environmental exposures and community characteristics of the built environment collectively predict rapid lung function decline, during adolescence and early adulthood in cystic fibrosis (CF), has not been examined.

## Objective
To identify built environment characteristics predictive of rapid CF lung function decline.

## Methods
We performed a retrospective, single-center, longitudinal cohort study (n = 173 individuals with CF aged 6-20 years, 2012-2017). We used a stochastic model to predict lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) of % predicted. Traditional demographic/clinical characteristics were evaluated as predictors. Built environmental predictors included exposure to elemental carbon attributable to traffic sources (ECAT), neighborhood material deprivation (poverty, education, housing, and healthcare access), greenspace near the home, and residential drivetime to the CF center.

## Measurements and main results
The final model, which included ECAT, material deprivation index, and greenspace, alongside traditional demographic/clinical predictors, significantly improved fit and prediction, compared with only demographic/clinical predictors (Likelihood Ratio Test statistic: 26.78, p < 0.0001; the difference in Akaike Information Criterion: 15). An increase of 0.1 Î¼g/m3 of ECAT was associated with 0.104% predicted/yr (95% confidence interval: 0.024, 0.183) more rapid decline. Although not statistically significant, material deprivation was similarly associated (0.1-unit increase corresponded to additional decline of 0.103% predicted/year [-0.113, 0.319]). High-risk regional areas of rapid decline and age-related heterogeneity were identified from prediction mapping.

## Conclusion

Traffic-related air pollution exposure is an important predictor of rapid pulmonary decline that, coupled with community-level material deprivation and routinely collected demographic/clinical characteristics, enhance CF prognostication and enable personalized environmental health interventions.
